Source code disclosure is a security vulnerability where server-side source code is unexpectedly exposed to users or unauthorized parties, 
often due to misconfigurations or application flaws. This disclosure can lead to attackers gaining sensitive information, such as database credentials, 
administrative access, or detailed knowledge of the application's logic, which enables them to launch further attacks.
